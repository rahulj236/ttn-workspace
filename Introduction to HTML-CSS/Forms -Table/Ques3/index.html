                    Park City native, Laura Blake, won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
                    long distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off
                    the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished
                    second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA
                    Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.

                    In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
                    marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the
                    race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second, when he could not match Teagan's finishing
                    pace. Jason Wu of Cutler, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.

                    This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85Â°.
